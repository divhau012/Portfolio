  Div: spirited, energetic, selfless. These are a few phrases I use to describe myself. I am Divya Hauzaree, a current senior at American High
	    School. I currently play varsity tennis for my school team and am involved in clubs such as Interact. During this 2017 summer, 
	    I am actively participating in the program Girls Who Code. </p> </font>

  I have many aspirations, one being to be a computer scientist. Once I graduate college, I hope to get a job working at a big company such as Nasa or Google.

My favorite hobby is playing tennis. Tennis invloves a lot of concentration and determination. This is a mental sport, as well as a physical sport, and tests how well one does under pressure. I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old and I plan to continue playing in college. </p> </font>

In addition to tennis, I am involved in Interact, an international club whose goal is to help the community. This year, our national project was mental health and our international project was Syrian Refugees. Interactors raised money and awareness about these topics. I was a Community Outreach Interact Officer during the 2016-2017 school year and I plan on being an active member next year. </p> </font>

		<p style="text-alight:left; font-size: 10px;  margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"> This circut was made with two jumper wires, one resistor, one lightbulb in addition to the breadboard and battery. This was made with a lot of trial and error. 
		   Along the way, I discovered that the 5 pins in the same horizontal row were connected. The circut was not working at first because the circut was not "closed." 
		   Once the pins were aligned in the rows, the circut was closed and the light turned on. Though we burned out two bulbs along the way, we successfully completed the task. </p>

Robots, nowadays, are able to complete human tasks better than humans. I am excited to see where the future of robots can go, I am expecting flying cars somewhat soon. It does make me nervous that robots are smarter than humans,
		yet still do not have morals or a sense or feeling. <br>
	My group worked well togther. We had many different ideas and though most of them were unsuccessful, we figured out the problem in the end and completed the task. It was easier
		to do this because we had four different ideas put together instead of just one. <br> ~		~		~		~
