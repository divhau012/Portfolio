  Div: spirited, energetic, selfless. These are a few phrases I use to describe myself. I am Divya Hauzaree, a current senior at American High
	    School. I currently play varsity tennis for my school team and am involved in clubs such as Interact. During this 2017 summer, 
	    I am actively participating in the program Girls Who Code. </p> </font>

  I have many aspirations, one being to be a computer scientist. Once I graduate college, I hope to get a job working at a big company such as Nasa or Google.

My favorite hobby is playing tennis. Tennis invloves a lot of concentration and determination. This is a mental sport, as well as a physical sport, and tests how well one does under pressure. I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old and I plan to continue playing in college. </p> </font>

In addition to tennis, I am involved in Interact, an international club whose goal is to help the community. This year, our national project was mental health and our international project was Syrian Refugees. Interactors raised money and awareness about these topics. I was a Community Outreach Interact Officer during the 2016-2017 school year and I plan on being an active member next year. </p> </font>

		<p style="text-alight:left; font-size: 10px;  margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto;"> This circut was made with two jumper wires, one resistor, one lightbulb in addition to the breadboard and battery. This was made with a lot of trial and error. 
		   Along the way, I discovered that the 5 pins in the same horizontal row were connected. The circut was not working at first because the circut was not "closed." 
		   Once the pins were aligned in the rows, the circut was closed and the light turned on. Though we burned out two bulbs along the way, we successfully completed the task. </p>

        <li style= "font-size: 14px; text-align: center; margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">7/10/17 - Robotics is advancing quickly. Robots, nowadays, are able to complete human tasks better than humans. I am excited to see where the future of robots can go, I am expecting flying cars somewhat soon. It does make me nervous that robots are smarter than humans,
		yet still do not have morals or a sense or feeling. <br> <br>
	My group worked well togther. We had many different ideas and though most of them were unsuccessful, we figured the problem out and completed the task. It was easier
		to perform this task because we had four different ideas put together instead of just one. <br>

		Manuela Veloso's work has to do with robots around the office, listening to verbal comands. They both 
		are trying to help advance technology by developing complex robots who complete different tasks. <br> <br>
		My team worked well together on the light show. We included four different light bulbs blinking on and off at different times while one bulb changes colors. We could have made the code more complex by introducing arrays to our C++ code. Most Arduino sketches involve void setup() to define variables and set up the pins. In addition, they can include void loops() to repeat a command and if-else statements.

		<br><br>
		My favorite part of my robots dance was when it sang "Under the Sea." I love Disney's "Little Mermaid" so I enjoyed the process of making this song with the Piezo.

		Manuela Veloso and Ayanna Howard both need outputs that involve reponse to objects touching them and human interaction.

		<br> <br>Programmers can do multiple things to help protect the privacy of their users. For example, programmers can ensure that the passwords require characters such as 
		"!, @, $". This will prevent hackers from successfully guessing users' passwords. 
		<br><br>Programmers like Latanya Sweeney and Shafi Goldwasser both study and work to create programs that help protect users privacy.

		the robot light show because it involved working with circuits, which I enjoy. I would like to add more extensions to this project if possible. In addition, I enjoyed making this portfolio 
		and would definitely be interested in improving it. <br><br>
		I would like to learn more about Java and the actual coding part. I would enjoy getting more exposure to the actual language.

		Data science is intriguing, however, I am not fond of statistics, which is important in this field. <br><br>
		Algorithms are interesting because one small change can lead to saving a lot of time. For example, using the bubble-sorting method can be inefficient and can take triple the amount of time compared to the partition-sorting method. 
		Algorithms are extremely useful and is used in everyday life with computers. Different algorithms allow the computer to run extremely fast or extremely slow.
