  Div: sprited, energetic, selfless. These are some phrases I use to desribe myself. I am Divya Hauzaree, a current senior at American High School. I currently play varsity tennis for my school team and am involved in clubs such as Interact. Summer 2017  programs such as Girls Who Code. I have many aspirations, one being to be a computer scientist.
