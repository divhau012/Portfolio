  Div: sprited, energetic, selfless. These are a few phrases I use to desribe myself. I am Divya Hauzaree, a current senior at American High
	    School. I currently play varsity tennis for my school team and am involved in clubs such as Interact. During this 2017 summer, 
	    I am actively involved in the program Girls Who Code. </p>

  I have many aspirations, one being to be a computer scientist. Once I graduate college, I hope to get a job working at a big company such as Nasa or Google.

My favorite hobby is playing tennis. Tennis invloves a lot of concentration and determination. This is a mental sport, as well as a physical sport, and tests how well one does under pressure. I have been playing tennis since I was eight years old and I plan to continue playing in college. </p>
  <p style="text-align:center; margin-right: 150px; margin-left: 150px;">
In addition to tennis, I am involved in Interact, an international club whose goal is to do community service. This year, our national project was mental health and our international project was Syrian Refugees. Interactors raised money and awareness about these topics. I was a Community Outreach Interact Officer during the 2016-2017 school year and I plan on being an active member next year. </p>
